This project concerns the creation of a machine learning model capable of adding accompaniments to melodies. The hope is that a user can upload a recording of themselves playing a melody, and then download the recording with a generated accompaniment added on.

## Acousitics and Music Theory
### Sounds and Waves
A sound is simply a vibration that propogates as an audible wave of pressure through a medium. We can represent sound mathematically as a wave. The simplest wave is arguably a sinusoidal wave, such as $A\cos(wt)$ where $A$ is the amplitude, $\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $t$ is time.

For example, we plot a 2 Hz sinusoidal wave, with an amplitude of 0.5, below:
