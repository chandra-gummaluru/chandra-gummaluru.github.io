This project concerns the creation of a machine learning model capable of adding accompaniments to melodies. The hope is that a user can upload a recording of themselves playing a melody, and then download the recording with a generated accompaniment added on.

## Acousitics and Music Theory
### Sounds and Waves
A sound is simply a vibration that propogates as an audible wave of pressure through a medium. We can represent sound mathematically as a wave. The simplest wave is arguably a sinusoidal wave, such as $A\cos(wt)$ where $A$ is the amplitude, $\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $t$ is time.

For example, we plot a 2 Hz sinusoidal wave, with an amplitude of 0.5, below:

It turns out that the average human can hear frequencies between 20 Hz to 22 kHz, and so the above wave would actually be inaudible. However, if we change the frequency to be within that range, say 440 Hz, it sounds something like this:

<audio controls src="https://github.com/chandra-gummaluru/chandra-gummaluru.github.io/raw/46cfd9d7f4f59a3df411da0092624402276d2c33/assets/440hz_wave.wav"></audio>

Since $\cos{t}$ is $2\pi$ periodic, the **temporal frequency**, $f$ of the wave is given by
$$f = \frac{\omega}{2\pi}.$$

The **percieved pitch** of a sound wave is directly proportional to this frequency. However, the **percieved pitch difference** between two sound waves is logarithmic w.r.t. the frequencies. For example, the pitch difference between a 220 Hz and 440 Hz wave is the same as that between the 440 Hz and an 880 Hz wave.

If we play the 220 Hz, 440 Hz and 880 Hz waves in succession, they sound like this:

### Musical Notes

Each pitch interval is seperated by 12 uniformally spaced points forming the 12 **notes** of the Western scale. The frequency of a note is thus exactly $\sqrt[12]{2}$ times that of the previous note. 

Conventionally, we denote these notes (in increasing pitch) with $\mathrm{A}$, $\mathrm{A}^♯$ or $\mathrm{B}^♭$, $\mathrm{B}$, $\mathrm{B}^♯$ or $\mathrm{C}^♭$, $\mathrm{C}$, $\mathrm{C}^♯$ or $\mathrm{D}^♭$, $\mathrm{D}$, $\mathrm{D}^♯$ or $\mathrm{E}^♭$, $\mathrm{E}$, $\mathrm{F}$, $\mathrm{F}^♯$ or $\mathrm{G}^♭$, and $\mathrm{G}$.

Any set of 12 consecutive notes is called an **octave**. Since music typically consists of notes from multiple octaves, subscripts are commonly used to denote which one a given note belongs to. For example, $\mathrm{G}_4$ refers to the $\mathrm{G}$ note of the 4th octave.

The frequency of $\mathrm{A}_4$ is 440 Hz, and so, the frequency (in Hz) of the $i$th note from $\mathrm{A}_4$, is given by $$440\times 2^{\frac{i}{12}},$$
where positive (resp. negative) values for $i$ indicate higher (resp. lower) pitch notes.

Note durations are defined in terms of **beats**. Commonly used notes and rests are defined in the table below:

    <td style="text-align:center">$\frac{1}{4}$</td>
  </tr>
</table>
Durations smaller than sixteenth do exist, but are used less often.

The absolute duration of a beat depends on the **tempo** of the piece, which is usually expressed in beats / min.

### The Piano
For the purpose of this project, we will be focusing on just piano music. On a piano, notes correspond to particular keys as shown below:
