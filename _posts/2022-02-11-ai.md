The following material is heavily based on material developed by many individuals for [CSC384 taught at the University of Toronto](https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/csc384h1). All typos are my own.

 1. **Defining Intelligence** ([notes](https://github.com/chandra-gummaluru/chandra-gummaluru.github.io/raw/e83faa3902f78ef3d41c5471754287d44c3dc3df/media/ai/slides/chpt1.pdf))<br>
 In this chapter, we attempt to define "intelligence" through a set of behaviours. In the following chapters, we will consider develop algorithmic techniques to instill such behaviours in artificial agents.
  
 2. **Search: Introduction** ([notes](https://github.com/chandra-gummaluru/chandra-gummaluru.github.io/raw/e83faa3902f78ef3d41c5471754287d44c3dc3df/media/ai/slides/chpt2.pdf))<br>
 An intelligent agent should be able to search its environment. In this chapter, we formally define a "search problem" and introduce a generalized search algorithm. We clarify the difference between planning problems and locating problems.
 
 3. **Search: Uninformed Search** <br>In this chapter, we develop a few simple search algorithms to address search problems and analyize their properties. These algorithms are uninformed because they do not take into account any specific information about the problem.

 4. **Search: Informed Search** <br>In many cases, specific information about the problem itself can help improve a search. In this chapter, we develop search algorithms that make use of such information, and analyze their properties.
 
 5. **Search: Constraint Satisfaction Problems** ([notes](https://github.com/chandra-gummaluru/chandra-gummaluru.github.io/raw/master/media/ai/slides/chpt5.pdf))<br>In this chapter, we focus on developing a more efficient representation of locating problems. We also develop specialized algorithms to solve such problems

 6. **Search: Adversarial Search** ([notes](https://github.com/chandra-gummaluru/chandra-gummaluru.github.io/raw/master/media/ai/slides/chpt6.pdf))<br>Thus far, we have assumed that we have complete control of our environment when searching. However, this assumption rarely holds in practice. In this chapter, we relax the assumption and consider search problems in which we are up against an adversary. 
 
 7. **Uncertainty: Representation** <br> An intelligent angent should also be able to act under uncertainty. In this chapter, we review basic probability theory, the maths of uncertainty, and introduce a graphical tool (called a Bayesian network) to reason about random but related variables.

 8. **Uncertainty: Inference** <br> In this chapter, we develop algorithms to infer probabalistic statements given a Bayesian network.

 9. **Knowledge: Representation** ([notes](https://github.com/chandra-gummaluru/chandra-gummaluru.github.io/raw/master/media/ai/slides/chpt9.pdf)) <br> An intelligent agent should havea way of representing explicit knowledge, and then use it to infer implict facts. In this chapter, we focus on formal ways of representing knowledge.
 
 10. **Knwoledge: Reasoning** ([notes](https://github.com/chandra-gummaluru/chandra-gummaluru.github.io/raw/master/media/ai/slides/chpt10.pdf)) <br> In this chapter, we develop techniques to infer implicit facts in a knowledge base.
