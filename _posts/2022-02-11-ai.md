The following material is heavily based on material developed by many individuals for [CSC384 taught at the University of Toronto](https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/csc384h1). All typos are my own.

## Introduction
Our goal is to develop algorithms that can optimally make decisions in various situations. We model these situations as games in the game-theoretic sense. We develop these definitions in greater detail in this module.

- [Lecture 1: Formalizing Intelligence](https://github.com/chandra-gummaluru/chandra-gummaluru.github.io/raw/master/media/ai/csc384-notes-lec01.pdf)

Designing algorithms for arbitrary games is quite difficult. Thus, in the following modules, we will begin by making some simplifying assumptions. Later, we will relax these assumptions.

## Search Problems and Algorithms
In this module, we consider a type of game called a search problem. We develop algorithms to solve search problems, and then analyze their various properties.
