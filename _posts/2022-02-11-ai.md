The following material is heavily based on material developed by many individuals for [CSC384 taught at the University of Toronto](https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/csc384h1). All typos are my own.

## Search
In this module, we formally define a "search problem" and introduce a generalized search algorithm. We develop a few specific but simple search algorithms to address search problems and analyize their properties. Finally, we consider using heuristics to reduce the complexities of the aforementioned algorithms.

## Constraint Satisfaction Problems
In this module, we formally define a "constraint satisfaction problem", which can be thought of as a special type of search problem. We develop specialized algorithms that are more efficient.
