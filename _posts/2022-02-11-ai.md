The following material is heavily based on material developed by many individuals for [CSC384 taught at the University of Toronto](https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/csc384h1). All typos are my own.

 1. **Defining Intelligence:** ([notes](https://github.com/chandra-gummaluru/chandra-gummaluru.github.io/raw/e83faa3902f78ef3d41c5471754287d44c3dc3df/media/ai/slides/chpt1.pdf))
 In this chapter, we attempt to define "intelligence" through a set of behaviours. In the following chapters, we will consider develop algorithmic techniques to instill such behaviours in artificial agents.
  
 2. **Search: Introduction:** ([notes](https://github.com/chandra-gummaluru/chandra-gummaluru.github.io/raw/e83faa3902f78ef3d41c5471754287d44c3dc3df/media/ai/slides/chpt2.pdf))
 An intelligent agent should be able to search its environment. In this chapter, we formally define a "search problem" and introduce a generalized search algorithm.
