## Linear Spaces and their Subspaces
To define the notion of a linear space, we must first define the notion of a field. Loosely speaking, a field is any set endowed with a sense of addition and multiplication. A formal definition is given below.

> **Def. Field**: A **field**, $\mathbb{F}$, is any set of elements endowed with the operations, $+: \mathbb{F} \times \mathbb{F} \rightarrow \mathbb{F}$ called addition, and $\cdot: \mathbb{F} \times \mathbb{F} \rightarrow \mathbb{F}$, called multiplication, such that the following properties are satisfied:
> - **commutativity**: $u+v = v + u$ and $u\cdot v = v \cdot u$ for all $u, v \in \mathbb{F}$.
> - **associativity**: $(u+v)+w = u+(v+w)$ and $(u\cdot v)\cdot w = u\cdot (v\cdot w)$ for all $u, v, w \in \mathbb{F}$.
> - **distributivity**: $u \cdot (v+w) = u \cdot v + u \cdot w$ for all $u, v, w \in \mathbb{F}$. 
> - **identities**: there exists $0 \in \mathbb{F}$, called the additive identity, and $1 \in \mathbb{F}$ called the multiplicative identity, such that $v + 0 = 1 \cdot v = v$ for all $v \in \mathbb{F}$.
> -**inverses**: for every $v \in \mathbb{F}$, there exists $-v, v^{-1} \in \mathbb{F}$, called the additive and multiplicative inverses, such that $v + (-v) = 0$ and $v \cdot v^{-1} = 1$. 
 
Linear spaces are defined over fields.

> **Def. Linear Space**: A **linear space**, $\mathcal{V}$ over a field, $\mathbb{F}$, is a set of elements endowed with the operations $+: \mathcal{V} \times \mathcal{V} \rightarrow \mathcal{V}$, called addition, and $\cdot: \mathcal{V} \times \mathbb{F} \rightarrow \mathcal{V}$, called scalar multiplication, such that the following properties are satisfied:
> - **commutativity of addition**: $u + v = v + u, \forall u, v \in \mathcal{V}$,
> - **associativity of addition**: $(u + v) + w = u + (v + w), \forall u, v, w \in \mathcal{V}$,
> - **distributivity**: $s(u+v) = su + sv$ and $u(s+t) = su + st, \forall u, v \in \mathcal{V}, s, t \in \mathcal{F}$,
> - **identities**: there exists $\textbf{0} \in \mathcal{V}$ called the additive identity, and $1 \in \mathbb{F}$ called the multiplicative identity, such that $v + \textbf{0} = 1v = v$  for all $v \in \mathcal{V}$,
> - **additive inverse**: $\forall v \in \mathcal{V}$ there exists $-v \in \mathcal{V}$, called the additive inverse, such that $v + (-v) = \textbf{0}$.
