## Linear Spaces and their Subspaces
To define the notion of a linear space, we must first define the notion of a field. Loosely speaking, a field is any set endowed with a sense of addition and multiplication. A formal definition is given below.

> **Def. Field**: A **field**, $\mathbb{F}$, is any set of elements endowed with the operations, $+: \mathbb{F} \times \mathbb{F} \rightarrow \mathbb{F}$ called addition, and $\cdot: \mathbb{F} \times \mathbb{F} \rightarrow \mathbb{F}$, called multiplication, such that the following properties are satisfied:
> - **commutativity**: $u+v = v + u$ and $u\cdot v = v \cdot u$ for all $u, v \in \mathbb{F}$.
> - **associativity**: $(u+v)+w = u+(v+w)$ and $(u\cdot v)\cdot w = u\cdot (v\cdot w)$ for all $u, v, w \in \mathbb{F}$.
> - **distributivity**: $u \cdot (v+w) = u \cdot v + u \cdot w$ for all $u, v, w \in \mathbb{F}$. 
> - **identities**: there exists $0 \in \mathbb{F}$, called the additive identity, and $1 \in \mathbb{F}$ called the multiplicative identity, such that $v + 0 = 1 \cdot v = v$ for all $v \in \mathbb{F}$.
> - **inverses**: for every $v \in \mathbb{F}$, there exists $-v, v^{-1} \in \mathbb{F}$, called the additive and multiplicative inverses, such that $v + (-v) = 0$ and $v \cdot v^{-1} = 1$. 
 
Linear spaces are defined over fields.

> **Def. Linear Space**: A **linear space**, $\mathcal{V}$ over a field, $\mathbb{F}$, is a set of elements endowed with the operations $+: \mathcal{V} \times \mathcal{V} \rightarrow \mathcal{V}$, called addition, and $\cdot: \mathcal{V} \times \mathbb{F} \rightarrow \mathcal{V}$, called scalar multiplication, such that the following properties are satisfied:
> - **commutativity of addition**: $u + v = v + u, \forall u, v \in \mathcal{V}$,
> - **associativity of addition**: $(u + v) + w = u + (v + w), \forall u, v, w \in \mathcal{V}$,
> - **distributivity**: $s(u+v) = su + sv$ and $u(s+t) = su + st, \forall u, v \in \mathcal{V}, s, t \in \mathcal{F}$,
> - **identities**: there exists $\textbf{0} \in \mathcal{V}$ called the additive identity, and $1 \in \mathbb{F}$ called the multiplicative identity, such that $v + \textbf{0} = 1v = v$  for all $v \in \mathcal{V}$,
> - **additive inverse**: $\forall v \in \mathcal{V}$ there exists $-v \in \mathcal{V}$, called the additive inverse, such that $v + (-v) = \textbf{0}$.

While multiplication in $\mathbb{F}$ must be commutative and associative, its extension in $\mathcal{V}$ need not be. Similarly, while $\mathbb{F}$ must contain multiplicative inverses for all of its elements, $\mathcal{V}$ need not. Consequently,  any field is a linear spaces over itself. However, not every linear space is a field.

> **Def. Linear Combination, Span, and Dimension**: Let $\mathcal{X}$ be a linear space over a field, $\mathbb{F}$. A \textbf{linear combination} of $x_1, \dots, x_m \in \mathcal{X}$ is of the form
> \[\lambda_1x_1 + \dots + \lambda_mx_m, \lambda_i \in \mathbb{F}.\]
> The \textbf{span} of $x_1, \dots, x_m$, denoted $\text{span}(x_1, \dots, x_m)$ is the set of all possible linear combinations of $x_1, \dots, x_m$, i.e.,
> \[\text{span}(x_1, \dots, x_m) = \left\lbrace \sum_{i=1}^{m}\lambda_ix_i | \lambda_i \in \mathbb{F} \right\rbrace.\]
> The smallest $m$ for which there exist a set of vectors, $x_1, \dots, x_m \in \mathcal{X}$ such that $\Span(x_1, \dots, x_m) = \mathcal{X}$ is called the \textbf{dimension} of $\mathcal{X}$, denoted $\Dim(\mathcal{X})$.

> **Def. Linear Independence and Basis Sets**: Let $\mathcal{X}$ be a linear space over a field, $\mathbb{F}$. We say $x^{(1)}, \dots, x^{(m)} \in \mathcal{X}$ are \textbf{linearly independent} if $\lambda_1x^{(1)} + \dots + \lambda_mx^{(m)} = 0$ only when $\lambda_1 = \dots = \lambda_m = 0$. A \textbf{basis} for $\mathcal{X}$ is any set of $\text{dim}(\mathcal{X})$ linearly independent elements within $\mathcal{X}$ that also span $\mathcal{X}$.
> <br><br>
> We refer to $\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_m$ as the \textbf{coefficients} of $x$ under the basis $\mathscr{X}$.

Generally speaking, linear spaces can be defined using any object. We will primarily focus on linear spaces of vectors, matrices, and functions. We will go into more detail about each of these objects in following sections. We will see that many of the linear spaces we work with also have additional structure which make them subspaces.
