## Linear Spaces and their Subspaces
To define the notion of a linear space, we must first define the notion of a field. Loosely speaking, a field is any set endowed with a sense of addition and multiplication. A formal definition is given below.

> **Def. Field**
> A **field**, $\mathbb{F}$, is any set of elements endowed with the operations, $+: \mathbb{F} \times \mathbb{F} \rightarrow \mathbb{F}$ called addition, and $\cdot: \mathbb{F} \times \mathbb{F} \rightarrow \mathbb{F}$, called multiplication, such that the following properties are satisfied:
> -**commutativity**: $u+v = v + u$ and $u\cdot v = v \cdot u$ for all $u, v \in \mathbb{F}$.
> -**associativity**: $(u+v)+w = u+(v+w)$ and $(u\cdot v)\cdot w = u\cdot (v\cdot w)$ for all $u, v, w \in \mathbb{F}$.
> -**distributivity**: $u \cdot (v+w) = u \cdot v + u \cdot w$ for all $u, v, w \in \mathbb{F}$. 
> -**identities**: there exists $0 \in \mathbb{F}$, called the additive identity, and $1 \in \mathbb{F}$ called the multiplicative identity, such that $v + 0 = 1 \cdot v = v$ for all $v \in \mathbb{F}$.
> -**inverses**: for every $v \in \mathbb{F}$, there exists $-v, v^{-1} \in \mathbb{F}$, called the additive and multiplicative inverses, such that $v + (-v) = 0$ and $v \cdot v^{-1} = 1$. 
 
Linear spaces are defined over fields.
