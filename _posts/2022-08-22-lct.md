# Signals
> **Def. Continuous-Time Signal:** A **continuous-time signal** is a function, $u: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ where $u(t)$ is the signal's value at time, $t$.
 
We will often view a continuous-time signal, $x$, as linear combinations of basis signals, say
\\[u(t) = \sum\_{k}\hat{u}\_k\phi_k(t).\\]
Some continuous-time signals exhibit special properties which can often be exploited to simplify their analysis. We now define some of these properties.
<br><br>
We begin with the notion of even/odd-ness.
> **Def. Even/Odd Continuous-Time Signal:** A continuous-time signal, $u$, is **even** iff $u(t) = u(-t), \forall t \in \mathbb{R}$ and **odd** if $u(t) = -u(-t)$ for
> all $t \in \mathbb{R}$.

It turns out that any continuous-time signal, $u$, can be decomposed into a linear combination of even/odd components.

> **Thm. Even/Odd Decomposition of Continuous-Time Signals:** Any continuous-time signal, $u$, can be decomposed into odd and even components, namely,
> \\[u(t) = u^{\text{e}}(t) + u^{\text{o}}(t),\\]
> where
> \\[u^{\text{e}}(t) = \frac{1}{2}\left[u(t) + u(-t)\right] \text{ and } u^{\text{o}}(t) = \frac{1}{2}\left[u(t) - u(-t)\right].\\]

We consider a few important transformations of continuous-time signals.
> **Def. Continuous-Time Time Shifting:** A signal, $u\_{\tau}: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a **time-shift** of a signal, $u: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, if
> \\[u_{\tau}(t) = u(t-\tau), \forall t.\\]
> For $\tau > 0$, the time-shift is into the past, and for $\tau < 0$, it is into the future.

In theory, it is possible to measure a continuous-time signal exactly at any time, $t \in \mathbb{R}$. However, in practice we must often resort to computing a (possibly non-uniform) mean measurement of the signal within some finite region, $R_t$ around $t$.
\\\\
More precisely, we may only compute
\\[\int_{R_t}\phi(\tau)u(\tau)d\tau,\\]
where $\phi: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ denotes the weighting over $R_t$.
