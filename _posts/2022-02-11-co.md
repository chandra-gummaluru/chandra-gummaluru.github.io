# Convex Optimization

## Sets, Hulls, and Spaces

### Conic Sets
A **conic combination** of the points, $x_1, \dots, x_n$ is of the form
\\[t_1x_1 + \dots t_nx_n\\] where $t_1,\dots,t_n \geq 0$.

A set, $C$, is **conic** if it contains all conic combinations of its points.

Given a possibly non-conic set, $S$, the set of all possible conic combinations of its points is called its **conic hull**, and is denoted $\text{conic}(S)$. Note that $\text{conic}(S)$ is conic set. 

### Convex Sets
A **convex combination** of the points, $x_1, \dots, x_n$ is of the form
\\[t_1x_1 + \dots t_nx_n\\] where $t_1,\dots,t_n \geq 0$, and $t_1 + \dots +t_n = 1$.

A set, $C$, is **convex** if it contains all convex combinations of its points.

Given a possibly non-convex set, $S$, the set of all possible convex combinations of its points is called its **convex hull**, and is denoted $\text{conv}(S)$. Note that $\text{conv}(S)$ is convex set. 

### Hyper-planes and Half-Spaces
A **hyperplane**, is a set of the form, $\left\lbrace a^{\top}x = b \right\rbrace$, where $a \neq 0$. Hyper-planes are convex, conic, and affine.

A **halfspace**, is a set of the form, $\left\lbrace a^{\top}x \leq b \right\rbrace$, where $a \neq 0$. Half-spaces are convex, but not conic or affine.
