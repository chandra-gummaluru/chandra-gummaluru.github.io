# Convex Optimization

## Convex Sets and Hulls

### Convex Sets
A **convex combination** of the points, $x_1, \dots, x_n$ is of the form
\[t_1x_1 + \dots t_nx_n\] where $t_1,\dots,t_n \geq 0$, and $t_1 + \dots +t_n = 1$.

A set, $C$, is **convex** if it contains all convex combinations of its points.

Given a possibly non-convex set, $S$, the set of all possible convex combinations of its points is called its **convex hull**, and is denoted $\text{conv}(S)$. Note that $\text{conv}(S)$ is convex set.
