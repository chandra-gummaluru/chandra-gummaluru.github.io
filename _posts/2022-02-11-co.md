## Convex Sets

### Definition of a Convex Set

Given $$n$$ points, $$x_1, \dots, x_n$$, the point $$t_1x_1 + \dots + t_nx_n$$, is called a **linear combination** of $$x_1, \dots, x_n$$.

If $$t_1, \dots, t_n \geq 0$$, then we have a **conic combination**.

If $$t_1 + \dots + t_n = 1$$, then we have a **convex combination**.

A set, $$S$$, is **linear**, **conic**, or **convex** iff it is closed under linear, conic, or convex combinations of its points, respectively.
