# Convex Sets and Functions

## Affine, Conic, and Convex Sets
We first define affine, conic, and convex sets.

### Affine Sets
An **affine combination** of the points, $x_1, \dots, x_n$ is of the form
\\[t_1x_1 + \dots t_nx_n\\] where $t_1 + \dots + t_n = 1$.

A set, $A$, is **affine** if it contains all affine combinations of its points.

Given a possibly non-affine set, $A$, the set of all possible affine combinations of its points is called its **affine hull**, and is denoted $\text{aff}(S)$. Note that $\text{aff}(S)$ is conic set. 


### Conic Sets
A **conic combination** of the points, $x_1, \dots, x_n$ is of the form
\\[t_1x_1 + \dots t_nx_n\\] where $t_1,\dots,t_n \geq 0$.

A set, $C$, is **conic** if it contains all conic combinations of its points.

Given a possibly non-conic set, $S$, the set of all possible conic combinations of its points is called its **conic hull**, and is denoted $\text{conic}(S)$. Note that $\text{conic}(S)$ is conic set. 

### Convex Sets
A **convex combination** of the points, $x_1, \dots, x_n$ is of the form
\\[t_1x_1 + \dots t_nx_n\\] where $t_1,\dots,t_n \geq 0$, and $t_1 + \dots +t_n = 1$.

A set, $C$, is **convex** if it contains all convex combinations of its points. Notice that all affine sets and conic sets are convex sets.

Given a possibly non-convex set, $S$, the set of all possible convex combinations of its points is called its **convex hull**, and is denoted $\text{conv}(S)$. The following relationship holds:

 - If $S$ is affine or conic, then it is convex.

## Examples of Convex Sets
We now consider some examples of convex sets.
### Hyper-planes and Half-Spaces
A **hyperplane**, is a set of the form, $\left\lbrace a^{\top}x = b \right\rbrace$, where $a \neq 0$. Hyper-planes are affine and (consequently) convex.

A **halfspace**, is a set of the form, $\left\lbrace a^{\top}x \leq b \right\rbrace$, where $a \neq 0$. Half-spaces are convex, but not conic or affine.

### Norm Balls and Cones
A **norm**, is an operator, $\\|\cdot\\|$, such that the following properties are satisfied:

 - $\\|x\\| \geq 0$ and $\\|x\\| = 0 \Leftrightarrow x = 0$
 - $\\|tx\\| = \|t\|\\|x\\|$, for any $t \in \mathbb{R}$
 - $\\|x + y \\| \leq \\|x\\| + \\|y\\|$

A **norm ball** of radius, $r$, with center $x_c$, is a set of the form
\\[\left\lbrace x \text{ s.t. } \|x - x_c\| \leq r\right\rbrace\\] Norm balls are convex.

A **norm cone** is a set of the form
\\[\left\lbrace x \text{ s.t. } \|x\| \leq t \right\rbrace \\] Norm cones are convex.

### Polyhedra
A **polyhedron** is the solution set of finitely many linear equalities and/or inequalities:
\\[Ax \preceq b \text{ and } Cx = d \\] In other words, it is a set of the form
\\[\left\lbrace x \text{ s.t. } Ax \preceq b, Cx = d\right\rbrace\\]
Polyhedra are convex.

## Operations that Preserve Convexity
To show that a set, $S$, is convex, one can resort to the definition, i.e., show that
\\[x_1, x_2 \in S, t \in [0, 1] \Rightarrow tx_1 +(1-t)x_2 \in S\\]However, this is often difficult to do in practice.

Another option is to show that $S$ can be formed from convex sets using operations that preserve convexity. Such operations include, but are not limited to:

 - **Intersections:** If $S_1$ and $S_2$ are convex, then so is $S_1 \cap S_2$.
 - **Affine Correspondences:** If $S$ is a convex set, and $f(x) = Ax+ b$, then
   - the image of $S$ under $f$, i.e., $f(S) = \left\lbrace f(x) \text{ s.t. } x \in S \right\rbrace$ is also convex
   - the inverse image of $S$ under $f$, i.e., $f^{-1}(S) = \left\lbrace x \text{ s. t. } f(x) \in S \right\rbrace$ is also convex.
