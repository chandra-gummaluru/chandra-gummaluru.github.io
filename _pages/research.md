# A Game-Theoretic Approach to Optimizing Transit Systems with Autonomous Vehicles

A new mathematical model based on game-theory is developed to simulate different types of transit systems within an urban environment.

# Contour-Guided Image Completion with Perceptual Grouping

A modernized version of an image completion algorithm is implemented to automatically completes missing or occluded parts of images. The algorithm is used to faciliate an image editing framework that uses a novel methods to complete fragmented contours.
